This is an IAS Computer (also called IAS Machine, the first electronic computer ever, launched in 1951 by John von Neumann) simulator, built in ARM assembly.

The ias_engine.s file is the core that simulares the IAS computer. Interface.s allows the user to run a whole program, a single instruction, print content from registers and so on. Ias_state.s is the memory map, and main.s ties everything together.
